### Information Architecture
To structure this web CV, we applied a layout that prioritizes clarity, accessibility, and intuitive navigation. As a **single-page, multi-section website**, we designed a simple, fixed navigation bar that allows quick access to the sections **About, Skills, Education, Experience**, and a **Download CV** option. This setup enables users to quickly locate the most relevant information.

Each section focuses on presenting specific, relevant information in a logical flow:
- **About**: Provides an overview of the candidate, including essential details such as personal skills, location, and availability. This section introduces the candidate's key qualities.
- **Skills**: Organized into subsections for languages and hobbies, this section offers a more comprehensive view of the candidate's versatility and communication skills.
- **Education and Experience**: These sections are structured using individual cards with concise descriptions, showcasing academic and professional history with clarity. Each entry includes institutions, dates, and achievements, building credibility and ease of understanding.

Each section is encapsulated in visually distinct cards that enhance readability and organization, maintaining a modular, professional layout. The architecture balances structure with accessibility, ensuring that users can find essential information quickly without needing to scan through excessive data.

### Visual Design
The visual design of this web CV aims to be **professional, clean, and user-friendly**, with a layout that supports both readability and aesthetics. The color palette uses **gray and blue tones**, creating a formal and approachable look, while subtle shadows on the cards and profile images provide depth without overwhelming the content. The choice of font, **Lora**, adds an elegant touch that complements the clean lines of the layout, enhancing readability across devices and screen sizes.

The navigation bar at the top is designed in a dark tone to contrast with the background, making links easy to locate. This fixed bar allows users to navigate seamlessly between sections while preserving a polished appearance. Each section’s title has a **decorative bar** on the left, using a blue accent from the palette to add a modern, structured feel that directs attention to the content. 

Cards in each section have a white background and light shadows, which help distinguish each piece of content from the main background. This contrast not only organizes information but also visually separates individual accomplishments, enhancing the CV’s professionalism and readability. Social media icons in the top bar provide a subtle option for candidates to share their online profiles, blending functionality with minimalist design.

### Bootstrap usage: 
This project uses **Bootstrap** as the primary CSS framework to enhance layout responsiveness and provide a consistent, professional design. Using Bootstrap allowed us to maintain focus on content organization and user experience while benefiting from a framework known for its reliability and responsiveness in web design.
